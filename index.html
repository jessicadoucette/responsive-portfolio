		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>Welcome to my page! My name is Jessica Doucette, but most people call me Jess. I'm 25, have 9 1/2 toes, and currently live
			in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
		<p>I work as a Digital Marketing Manager for Utah's Biggest IT Reseller. I primarely do graphic design, email marketing, manage
			the website, and run digital campaigns for the organization. We host over 100 events a year in the Rocky Mountain West,
			including a two-day, two-course golf tournament for our customers, and our charity foundation which benefits the Huntsman
			Cancer Foundation.</p>
		<p>I love to eat. Love to bake. Love to cook. I'm on a mission to find the best soft pretzel in Salt Lake City (
			<a href="http://www.bendbrewingco.com/our-pub/">after a religious experience in Bend, Oregon</a>), and it must be paired with beer cheese. I try to eat fried chicken
			as much as possible, and make the best molasses cookies in town.</p>
		<p>
			I dream of travelling more and eating more cuisine around the world. My wish is for coding to take me to new places so I
			can try more food and see more of the world.</p>
		<h2>My favorite things (off the top of my head)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>A good massage</li>
			<li>New workout gear</li>
