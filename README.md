<h1>Bootstrap Portfolio</h1>
<p>Assignment - to recreate the Basic Portfolio from Homework 1 with media queries. </p>

<h3>980</h3>
I decreased .inside-header width from 100% to 79% to respond better to the smaller viewport. 
.wrapper decreased from 920px to 75% to better respond to the browser.
I also adjusted the bio to 30% so it wouldn't be too small. 

<h3>768</h3>
#bio was adjusted to 40% -- eveything else responded well

<h3>640</h3>
Made header static, changed the flex-wrap to "wrap" so the nav items would wrap below the logo, and adjusted the #bio to 100%.
